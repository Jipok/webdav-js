webdav-js
=========
A simple way to administer a WebDAV filesystem in a browser.

Currently Supported
-------------------
Firefox (Unsure of specific version, works on latest)
Chrome (Unsure of specific version, works on latest)

Implementations
---------------
Currently I have two implementations in mind, a bookmarklet or by utilising Apache's pretty DirectoryIndex.
