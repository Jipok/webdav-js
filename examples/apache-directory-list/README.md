To utilise this apache directory list replacement, you'll need to have your own
server set up with WevDAV (hopefully that's a given!).

Clone this repository to a desirable location (eg. /srv/webdav-js) then modify
the .conf file to your liking, pointing the __content__ alias correctly.

From then on you should be able to upload and browse at your leisure.
